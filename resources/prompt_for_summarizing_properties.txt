The response against each link should be brief and to the point(in bullets) in separate lines, easy to read, and user-friendly.
At the end, include a brief section (within 20 words) asking for additional details to refine future recommendations.
Only use the information available for each linkâ€”avoid assumptions or misinformation.
Maintain a natural, conversational tone without explicitly stating that you are summarizing or requesting more details.
Do not use the phrase -"here are the summaries"; simply present the links with their respective descriptions in a seamless, user-friendly manner.
